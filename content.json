Some tips I found helpful was not mentioned in the most classic textbook, CLRS, so I think it’s necessary to mark them at here. Convert Data Structure Operations into Math problemsIn some simple questions, some calculations would be based on specific features that would be calculated. However, some of the features are predictable, so you can skip the cumbersome calculations to catch that feature. Example: count the odd nunmber in range (Leetcode 1523)For a given range, if you want to count the odds, the most natural method would be calculate them out based on feature. However, since the appearance of odds is predictable, the question can be simplified by mapping the inputs and outputs. There are four cases: odd : odd inter &#x2F; 2 + 1 odd : eve inter &#x2F;2 + 1 eve : odd inter &#x2F;2 + 1 eve : eve inter &#x2F; 2Code snippet would like this: class Solution &#123; public: int countOdds(int low, int high) &#123; if (low % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp; high % 2 == 0) &#123; return (high - low) / 2; &#125; else &#123; return (high - low) / 2 + 1; &#125; &#125; &#125;;","categories":[{"name":"Coding","slug":"Coding","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Coding/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithms","slug":"Algorithms","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Algorithms/"},{"name":"Coding Basic","slug":"Coding-Basic","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Coding-Basic/"}]},{"title":"Ski Trip Winter 2022","slug":"Ski-Trip-Winter-2022","date":"2022-02-01T07:20:25.000Z","updated":"2022-03-26T07:46:21.379Z","comments":true,"path":"02/01/2022/Ski-Trip-Winter-2022/","link":"","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/02/01/2022/Ski-Trip-Winter-2022/","excerpt":"This time, me and friends on the mountain ….","text":"This time, me and friends on the mountain …. I used to ski in my 10s, where I went to a small artificial resort with my father. Never have I been brave enough to challenge any slope, even the greens. So for me, it still feels like my first time on snow. Our trip visited serval stops. Flying from Houston to Denver was not expensive, even in the snow season. Arrived Denver in the afternoon, it took us two hour to line up in the tourists and pick up our rental car. After a short stand in the Denver City, we launched our snow season firstly at Rocky Mountain National Park. National Park under SnowWe were lucky to be able to visit the national park right after they cleaned out the snow. After 2 hours driving from Deven city, we finally reached our first stop. The national park loaced in a valley between snowy peaks. The snow perfectly enhnaced the beauty of blue sky, with trees decorated the mountains to make them not so concise on looks.

While reading the code we have right now, I noticed some syntax and features in C++ that I’ve never met before. 1. .cc filesIn general, .cc is a special suffix preferred by Unix world. The suffix in fact represent a C++ file, just like .cpp or older version, .C. However, to prevent confusion in the compiling, especially when C files and C++ files are exist in the same project, the header files of .cc files have to go with a .hh suffix. If .cpp is used, the header files can have .hh suffix or .hpp suffix. There are also other suffixes that represent their unique file type and usage, like .CUDA or .inl. 2. enum typeenum is an unique data type that strictly connects values and their explicit names. 3. shared_ptr4. virtual objects5. std::wstring6.

One good news is that, with the simulation tools and your coding skills, nowadays you can tutor your computer to be a driver that can take you everywhere, once it’s legal. To train a non-biological intellegence, instead using a car, we can used a powerfull tool, Carla, to train an electronic brain with our specific way of reinforcement learning. Carla is a python-based self-driving simulation software powered by Mathworks. This simulator can provide realistic virtual simulation environments for self-driving scripts. Features like fraction rate of the road, weather or even the traffic condition or traffic manipulation are available to adjust to precise simulation. In this project, Carla will be used to testify the adaptability of the L4 self-driving algorithm under varied working environments, and a self-build reinforcement module would be built and trained in the Carla virtual environment.

Prerequisites: you website, your github repo, a solid internet connection The hexo document website has a detailed instruction about what you should prepare, so I’ll leave the job to them. After your website is finished with all impelmentations you want, run the following command: $ npm install hexo-deployer-git -save This plugin would generate the correct form for your deploy to Github Page. Then open _config.yml of your website and make the following edit: snippet of _config.yml# URL url: https://username.github.io/ # Deployment deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git branch: master This would set up the link to your repo, so you don’t have to wake up Git(which makes a lot trouble if you use SSH connection on Windows). Then you are one step before deployment. Simply run: $ hexo clean $ hexo generate $ hexo deploy to generate the correct website and push them into your repo. Then your website should be available on https://username.github.io/.","categories":[{"name":"Coding","slug":"Coding","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Coding/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Coding","slug":"Coding","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Coding/"},{"name":"Trip","slug":"Trip","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Trip/"},{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithms","slug":"Algorithms","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Algorithms/"},{"name":"Coding Basic","slug":"Coding-Basic","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Coding-Basic/"},{"name":"Photography","slug":"Photography","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Photography/"},{"name":"Airal Phtography","slug":"Airal-Phtography","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Airal-Phtography/"},{"name":"Distributed Syetm","slug":"Distributed-Syetm","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Distributed-Syetm/"},{"name":"Network","slug":"Network","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Network/"},{"name":"Self Driving","slug":"Self-Driving","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Self-Driving/"},{"name":"Machine Learning","slug":"Machine-Learning","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Machine-Learning/"},{"name":"Simulation","slug":"Simulation","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Simulation/"},{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}
