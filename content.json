It’s not hard and not complicated. Follow up! Prerequisites: you website, your github repo, a solid internet connection The hexo document website has a detailed instruction about what you should prepare, so I’ll leave the job to them. After your website is finished with all impelmentations you want, run the following command: $ npm install hexo-deployer-git -save This plugin would generate the correct form for your deploy to Github Page. Then open _config.yml of your website and make the following edit: snippet of _config.yml# URL url: https://username.github.io/ # Deployment deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;reponame&gt;.git branch: master This would set up the link to your repo, so you don’t have to wake up Git(which makes a lot trouble if you use SSH connection on Windows). Then you are one step before deployment. Simply run: $ hexo clean $ hexo generate $ hexo deploy to generate the correct website and push them into your repo. Then your website should be available on https://username.github.io/.","categories":[{"name":"Coding","slug":"Coding","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Coding/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"gallery","slug":"gallery","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/gallery/"},{"name":"Coding","slug":"Coding","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Coding/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Algorithm","slug":"Algorithm","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Algorithm/"},{"name":"Distributed Syetm","slug":"Distributed-Syetm","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Distributed-Syetm/"},{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}
