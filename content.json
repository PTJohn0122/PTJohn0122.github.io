It’s not hard and not complicated. Follow up! Prerequisites: you website, your github repo, a solid internet connection The hexo document website has a detailed instruction about what you should prepare, so I’ll leave the job to them. After your website is finished with all impelmentations you want, run the following command: $ npm install hexo-deployer-git -save This plugin would generate the correct form for your deploy to Github Page. Then open _config.yml of your website and make the following edit: # URL url: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;username.github.io&#x2F; # Deployment deploy: type: git repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;&lt;username&gt;&#x2F;&lt;reponame&gt;.git branch: master This would set up the link to your repo, so you don’t have to wake up Git(which makes a lot trouble if you use SSH connection on Windows). Then you are one step before deployment. Simply run: $ hexo clean $ hexo generate $ hexo deploy to generate the correct website and push them into your repo. Then your website should be available on https://username.github.io/.","categories":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Programming/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/categories/Programming/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Distributed Syetm","slug":"Distributed-Syetm","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Distributed-Syetm/"},{"name":"Testing","slug":"Testing","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Testing/"},{"name":"Web Development","slug":"Web-Development","permalink":"https://xjhao.studio/tags/Web-Development/"}]}
